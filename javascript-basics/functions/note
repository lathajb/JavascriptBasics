Because of the way JavaScript works, with the prototype chain, etc., 
the sharing of functionality between objects is often called delegation. 
Specialized objects delegate functionality to a generic object type.

JavaScript gives us access to three global functions: 
-------------------------------------------------------

Object, Array, and Function. Yes, these are all functions.

console.log(Object); // -> ƒ Object() { [native code] }
console.log(Array); // -> ƒ Array() { [native code] }
console.log(Function); // -> ƒ Function() { [native code] }
